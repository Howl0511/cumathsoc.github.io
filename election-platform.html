            Hello I am Karl Roscoe, I am a fourth-year undergraduate student here at Carleton in the Math + Computer Science B.Math honours degree.<br/>

            I was the previous president during the 2022-2023 school year, as well as your current Vice President, and would very much like to be your Mathematics and Statistics Society president once again! My plans for the next school year include (but are not limited to):</br></br>
 
1) Organising a start of year barbecue.</br>
2) Hosting more colloquia targeted towards first and second year students.</br>
3) Host collaborative events with the computer science society and possibly others as well.</br>
4) Host monthly pancake breakfasts to build a strong community.</br>
5) Host more career focused events</br>

  <br/>
Please consider voting for me, I believe my past experience makes me an ideal candidate for Math&Stats Soc president!

Hello all! My name is Kevin Giddings. I am running for both the positions of president and vice president external. As a third-year student pursuing a Statistics B. Math Honours degree, I have had the privilege of attending many Math and Stats Society events where I built lasting friendships and furthered my passion for mathematics and statistics. As a member of the Math and Stats Society executive team, I would strive to create greater representation for statistics in the club. I aim to introduce a casino style game night, more statistics research presentations, and a review session for first year stats students, all the while continuing traditions such as the mathematics research colloquiums, calculus review sessions, and the annual integration bee. Through my experience as a math and stats TA, I am confident that I will be able to leverage my communication and teaching skills to find researchers excited about sharing their work, organize successful events, and host review sessions to assist both math and statistics students before their finals. I was able to meet my best friends at Carleton through the math society’s events, and I hope that through my position on the executive team I can allow new students this same opportunity.

Reason and goals for applying: I really liked the atmosphere, attitude, and events that the Math Soc did as a 1st year. By participating in some of the events and just being around the space, I wouldn't mind helping out planning for new events while I'm at it.</blockquote>

I'm Camila, second year standing in the mathematics and physics double major. I am running for VP internal because I am good at and passionate about organizing events and building community among mathematics students. I am very interested in applying my people and planning skills to help connect maths students to each other and to the rest of the university, to share the beauty and utility of our field. Mathematics helps us to understand the world, and collaboration helps us to understand mathematics; let's foster a community centering those goals :)

I am a first year student with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Linguistics thus far and I am running for the Treasurer administrative position.  My reasons are because I have a few interesting ideas for funding I would like to see implemented that I think would be of great benefit to the Mathematics Society.  My goal is to min max our funding, turn it into a fun optimization problem that I think solving would benefit everyone.  I mean those compsci kids figured out the rough structure but we can't let them upstage us come on.
