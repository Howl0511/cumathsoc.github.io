  "date": "Wednesday, Feburary 28th, 2024 @ 12:00pm",
  "location": "Herzberg (HP) 4351 - MacPhail",
  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> When a counting sequence appears in two different contexts, how do we know if this is a coincidence or something deeper? The Catalan numbers are a well-known integer sequence which shows up in many different counting problems in mathematics. In this talk, I will discuss the Catalan numbers and some lesser-known related sequences, as well as the relationships between these sequences. One of these Catalan-like sequences hints at an interesting connection between two seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics, which we will explore.",
