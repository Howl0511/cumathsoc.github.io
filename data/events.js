  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> Can one construct a proper n-gon only using straightedge (aruler with no marks) and compass? It turns out that the answer depends on the number n. There is a sufficient and necessary algebraic condition on n telling us for what n-gons such a construction exists. We shall discuss how construction goes, if it is possible. I will state the condition on n and explain why it is sufficient. However, it takes three full year courses in Abstract Algebra to understand why the condition is also necessary.",
