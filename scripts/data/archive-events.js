  "presentor": "Dr. James Bondar",
  "date": "Tuesday September 19 2023",
  "location": "Herzberg (HP) 3422",
  "desc": "It is often said that the best mathematics starts with very simple ideas. This is true of the pigeonhole principle which we first encounter as a riddle which can be solved by elementary school students. The applications of this simple principle lead in many directions: graph theory, the behaviour of billards balls, prime numbers, ... Some of these applications are deep and difficult and others are light and entertaining puzzles. We shall spend most of our time with the latter. Everyone is welcome!",

The former was solved recently in terms of a ratio of contour integrals, and we will derive a new closed-form solution to the latter. It turns out that a problem that is able to be stated in such simple terms will have an incredibly complex solution to the latter.",
