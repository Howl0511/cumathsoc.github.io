  "date": "Wednesday, April 3rd, 2024 @ 12:00pm",
  "location": "Herzberg (HP) 4351 - MacPhail",
  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> Little Picard Theorem says that an entire non-constant function $f : \\mathbb{C} â†’ \\mathbb{C}$ takes the values of whole complex plane or the plane minus a single point. This means that an analytic function over the complex field misses all but one values if it misses two values. This kind of behaviour is called the Picard jump by Lipton. In this talk, we discuss the similar behaviour of polynomials over finite fields.",
