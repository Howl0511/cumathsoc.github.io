  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> In this presentation I’ll talk about my experience working in government; first as a research mathematician, and now as a leader of a research organization. I’ll introduce you to the Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing (TIMC), as well as the larger organization (Communications Security Establishment) it supports – and talk a little more broadly about what you can expect from a career in the federal government. In addition (because this is, after all, the Carleton Math Society’s undergraduate colloquium series), I’ll give you an overview of the research work we do at TIMC.</br><p><b>Biography:</b> Megan Dewar leads the Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing (TIMC), a Canadian Government research institute whose mission is to deliver fundamental research results in mathematics and computer science that impact the most important scientific challenges facing the security and intelligence community. TIMC’s research program is focused on cryptography and data science.  Megan joined TIMC as a researcher at the time of its inception a decade ago and took on the role of Head in 2020. Megan completed her PhD in discrete mathematics at Carleton University in 2010 under the supervision of Dr Brett Stevens. She is a co-author of Ordering Block Designs:  Gray codes, universal cycles and configuration orderings, a book based on her thesis.  Her previous masters and undergraduate studies -- completed at Dalhousie University -- focused on graph theory and game theory.</p>",
