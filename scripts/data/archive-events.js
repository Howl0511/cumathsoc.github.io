  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> In this presentation I’ll talk about my experience working in government; first as a research mathematician, and now as a leader of a research organization. I’ll introduce you to the Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing (TIMC), as well as the larger organization (Communications Security Establishment) it supports – and talk a little more broadly about what you can expect from a career in the federal government. In addition (because this is, after all, the Carleton Math Society’s undergraduate colloquium series), I’ll give you an overview of the research work we do at TIMC.</br><p><b>Biography:</b> Megan Dewar leads the Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing (TIMC), a Canadian Government research institute whose mission is to deliver fundamental research results in mathematics and computer science that impact the most important scientific challenges facing the security and intelligence community. TIMC’s research program is focused on cryptography and data science.  Megan joined TIMC as a researcher at the time of its inception a decade ago and took on the role of Head in 2020. Megan completed her PhD in discrete mathematics at Carleton University in 2010 under the supervision of Dr Brett Stevens. She is a co-author of Ordering Block Designs:  Gray codes, universal cycles and configuration orderings, a book based on her thesis.  Her previous masters and undergraduate studies -- completed at Dalhousie University -- focused on graph theory and game theory.</p>",

  "location": "Herzberg (HP) 3422",
  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> Planar graphs have been the subject of intense study for over 300 years. This talk will present a recent structural result on planar graphs, which is now known as the Product Structure Theorem. It states that any planar graph G is contained in the product of two very simple graphs: a graph H that is tree-like and a path P. Since its appearance in 2020, the Product Structure Theorem has been used to resolve a number of longstanding open problems on planar graphs. This talk is aimed at a broad audience without any particular background in graph theory. It will include everything needed to understand the statement of the result, give a sketch of its proof, and describe some of its applications.",

This talk will give an exposition of an area of higher mathematics which uses tools from both sides of the MATH 1052/1152 coin. We will explore the ideas of this area in a few different levels of generality, and witness how analytic/topological data (such as compactness and connectedness) can be converted into algebraic data.",

  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> Hamiltonicity is a well-known and popular topic in graph theory. In a finite graph, a cycle is considered hamiltonian if it visits each vertex exactly once. However, when we shift our focus to infinite graphs, defining a cycle becomes less straightforward within an infinite setting. In this talk, we explore various approaches to define infinite cycles in infinite graphs. Additionally, we provide a concise summary of the results we have obtained concerning infinite hamiltonian cycles in graphs with a certain level of symmetries.",

  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> From the \"butterfly effect\" of weather prediction, to the vagaries of the stock market and the intricate beauty of snowflakes, examples of chaotic behavior surround us. But what is chaos? Is it a manifestation of some underlying random process? Is it a \"catch all\" for effects which we do not know or cannot resolve? In this presentation, I will talk about the mathematical notions behind chaos, and how it applies to a wide range of everyday phenomena. You will learn that behind the mysterious, seemingly random nature of chaos can lie a rich, intricate structure.  With this comes deeper understanding but such complexity also brings limitations. Through various examples we will explore how order emerges from disorder!",

The former was solved recently in terms of a ratio of contour integrals, and we will derive a new closed-form solution to the latter. It turns out that a problem that is able to be stated in such simple terms will have an incredibly complex solution to the latter.",
