  "title": "Selected Paradoxes in Mathematical Statistics",
  "date": "Wednesday, March 6th, 2024 @ 12:00pm",
  "location": "Herzberg (HP) 4351 - MacPhail",
  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> Mathematical statistics is a part of mathematics that has its own place in the hierarchy of natural sciences. In mathematical statistics we begin with experimental data, which generally consists of observed values of random variables, and make a decision concerning the nature of the phenomenon under study. The statement that the ‘practice is the criterion of truth’ is directly related to mathematical statistics, because it studies the methods which allow us to answer the question of whether or not the practice is adequate to a given hypothetical idea on the nature of the phenomenon. Mathematical statistics is rich in paradoxes. It is important to distinguish paradoxes from fallacies. The first ones are true, though surprising, theorems, while the second ones are false results obtained by reasonings that seem correct. In this talk, we shall consider several paradoxes dealing with parameter estimation and hypothesis testing, and provide explanations for these paradoxes.",
