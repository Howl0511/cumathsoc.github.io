  "desc": "<b>Abstract</b>In MATH 1052, you learn about sequences, limits, and continuity on the real line. In MATH 1152, you learn about vector spaces, matrices, and dimension. One course contains many ε’s and δ’s, while the other has row reduction and matrix-vector multiplication. What do they have in common? This talk will give an exposition of an area of higher mathematics which uses tools from both sides of the MATH 1052/1152 coin. We will explore the ideas of this area in a few different levels of generality, and witness how analytic/topological data (such as compactness and connectedness) can be converted into algebraic data.",

  "presentor": "Bobby Miraftab",
  "date": "October 10 2023",
  "location": "Herzberg (HP) 3422",
  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> Hamiltonicity is a well-known and popular topic in graph theory. In a finite graph, a cycle is considered hamiltonian if it visits each vertex exactly once. However, when we shift our focus to infinite graphs, defining a cycle becomes less straightforward within an infinite setting. In this talk, we explore various approaches to define infinite cycles in infinite graphs. Additionally, we provide a concise summary of the results we have obtained concerning infinite hamiltonian cycles in graphs with a certain level of symmetries.",
