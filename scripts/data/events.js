  "desc": "Let $f$ be a function defined over a finite set $X$. For any $x_0 \\in X$, consider successive compositions of $f$ with itself: $$ x_0, f(x_0), f(f(x_0)), f(f(f(x_0))), \\ldots.$$ When this is done for every element of $X$, a natural underlying graph, called the \"functional graph\" of $f$, emerges. This graph has as vertices the elements of $X$, and it has an edge from $a$ to $b$, $a,b \\in X$, if $f(a)=b$. We give examples showing the general structure of functional graphs. Then, we comment on applications of this area to computational algebra and cryptography. If time allows, we comment on some important parameters that have been studied in this area including periodic and pre-periodic points, average rho'' length, conditions for being a permutation function, and so on.",
