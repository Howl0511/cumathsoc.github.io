  "title": "On Colouring Points in the Plane",
  "presentor": "Prosenjit Bose",
  "date": "November 21, 2023",
  "location": "Herzberg (HP) 3422",
  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> You might be surprised to hear that the technologies behind everyday items like cell phones, maps, security systems, and even the game of Sudoku, rely on colouring points in the plane. A famous theorem about colour is the 4-colour theorem. The theorem states that, given a separation of a plane into adjoining regions (for example, think of a map), only four colours are needed to colour the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same colour. The applications for this notion are extensive. We will review a few examples of colouring in different contexts and give a flavour of some algorithms and proofs in this area.",
