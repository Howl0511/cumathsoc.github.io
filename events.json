                the internal and external grazing goat problem. The former was solved recently in terms of a ratio
                of contour integrals, and we will derive a new closed-form solution to the latter. It turns out
                that a problem that is able to be stated in such simple terms will have an incredibly complex solution
                to the latter.",
