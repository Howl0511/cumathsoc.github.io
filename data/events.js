  "date": "Wednesday, March 20th, 2024 @ 12:00pm",
  "location": "Herzberg (HP) 4351 - MacPhail",
  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> Most work on interpretability aims to give simple explanations of an entire neural network’s behavior. But what if instead we take an approach inspired by neuroscience and cellular biology - an approach of zooming in? What if we treated individual neurons, individual cells and its constituents, as being worthy of serious investigation? What if we were willing to spend thousands of hours tracing through every neuron and its connections? What kind of mechanistic understanding of neural networks would emerge? In this talk, I’ll motivate this field of mechanistic interpretability. We’ll see how this endeavor might not only be tractable, but also beautiful and approachable, in contrast to the typical depiction of neural networks as a black box.",
