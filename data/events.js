It is commonly used in a wide range of Ô¨Åelds such as bioinformatics, engineering, business, social media and security. But it has also gained a foothold in sports, starting with baseball and moving to football, soccer, tennis, cricket, hockey, golf, skiing, F1 racing, etc.. It is even is used to examine fan engagement and detect hidden patterns in gaming and wagering. Statistical analysis jobs provide exciting opportunities to combine an interest in statistics and computing with a passion for sports and business.
