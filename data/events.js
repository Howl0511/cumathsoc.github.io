  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, we will discuss how eigenvalue techniques from linear algebra may be applied to data science. We will begin with the PageRank algorithm which was at the core of Google's search engine. Google came relatively late to the market of search engines. Yet, the founders of Google saw how to use linear algebra for web search, and the algorithm they designed was far better than anything that previously existed. Linear algebra helped them to create a trillion-dollar company. The second method that we will review in this talk is the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). SVD is the analogue of matrix diagonalization for rectangular matrices. It is an extremely powerful tool, with a multitude of applications from topic classification of texts to the analysis of DNA to data compression. Finally, I will talk about my own work on clustering in large hypergraphs.",
