  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> From the \"butterfly effect\" of weather prediction, to the vagaries of the stock market and the intricate beauty of snowflakes, examples of chaotic behavior surround us. But what is chaos? Is it a manifestation of some underlying random process? Is it a \"catch all\" for effects which we do not know or cannot resolve? In this presentation, I will talk about the mathematical notions behind chaos, and how it applies to a wide range of everyday phenomena. You will learn that behind the mysterious, seemingly random nature of chaos can lie a rich, intricate structure.  With this comes deeper understanding but such complexity also brings limitations. Through various examples we will explore how order emerges from disorder!",
