  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> With increasing size and complexity of biological datasets, there is a growing need for developing statistical models for large, complex datasets. Modeling such datasets requires ﬂexible statistical models that can capture the various characteristics of the data and the underlying data-generating mechanisms. My research has coalesced around developing efficient and scalable statistical models for clustering various types of biological data. Cluster analysis is an unsupervised approach (no group labels are known a priori for any observation) and, therefore more challenging than a supervised classiﬁcation approach, in which some group labels for observations are known a priori. Model-based clustering identiﬁes and learns underlying groups using ﬂexible statistical models in data where no group information is known. In this talk, I will give an overview of cluster analysis, statistical models my research group has developed for various datatypes, and a discussion of some challenges and what lies ahead.",
