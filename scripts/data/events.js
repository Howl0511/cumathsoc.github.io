  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> In MATH 1052, you learn about sequences, limits, and continuity on the real line. In MATH 1152, you learn about vector spaces, matrices, and dimension. One course contains many ε’s and δ’s, while the other has row reduction and matrix-vector multiplication. What do they have in common? This talk will give an exposition of an area of higher mathematics which uses tools from both sides of the MATH 1052/1152 coin. We will explore the ideas of this area in a few different levels of generality, and witness how analytic/topological data (such as compactness and connectedness) can be converted into algebraic data.",
